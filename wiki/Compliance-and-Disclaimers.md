# Compliance and Disclaimers

Last reviewed: `2026-02-21`

## Non-Affiliation

This extension is an independent project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by ACGME**.

## Intended Audience

This tool is intended exclusively for anesthesia residents at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS). On first launch, users must check two confirmation boxes in the **Authorization Required** modal:

1. A confirmation that the user is an anesthesia resident at UPHS with authorized ACGME ADS access, and that they will use the tool only for their own case log submissions in accordance with program policies and ACGME Terms of Use.
2. A confirmation that the user is solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of all submitted case data, including data submitted in bulk via BEAST Mode, and that they will not use BEAST Mode without verifying case mappings on a sample of cases first.

This confirmation is stored in Chrome sync storage. Users who decline cannot proceed.

## Usage Preconditions

Use only when all are true:

1. You are an authorized ADS user at UPHS.
2. Your residency program has approved this workflow.
3. Your use complies with ACGME and ADS terms of use.
4. You are not using this tool for scraping, unauthorized access, credential sharing, or bypassing security controls.

- ADS entry point: <https://apps.acgme.org/ads/>

## Important Automation Caveat

ACGME terms include restrictions around automated means in certain contexts. Because this extension automates form interaction, you should obtain explicit institutional approval (and ACGME approval when required by your environment) before bulk automation behavior.

If approval is unclear, do not use bulk automation features.

## Legal Scope Limits

- This documentation is not legal advice.
- No documentation statement can guarantee compliance by itself.
- Compliance responsibility remains with users and their institutions.

# Compliance and Disclaimers

Last reviewed: `2026-02-20`

## Non-Affiliation

This extension is an independent project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by ACGME**.

## Usage Preconditions

Use only when all are true:

1. You are an authorized ADS user.
2. Your institution/program has approved this workflow.
3. Your use complies with ACGME and ADS terms.
4. You are not using this tool for scraping, unauthorized access, credential sharing, or bypassing security controls.

## Policy References

- ACGME Terms: <https://www.acgme.org/about/legal/terms-of-use>
- ADS entry point: <https://apps.acgme.org/ads/>

## Important Automation Caveat

ACGME terms include restrictions around automated means in certain contexts. Because this extension automates form interaction, you should obtain explicit institutional approval (and ACGME approval when required by your environment) before bulk automation behavior.

If approval is unclear, do not use bulk automation features.

Use this block in public docs/listings:

> This tool is intended only for authorized ADS users and policy-compliant, user-directed case-entry workflows. It does not bypass access controls, is not a scraping/mirroring tool, and is not affiliated with ACGME.

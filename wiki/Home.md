# ACGME Case Submitter Wiki

Use this wiki as the canonical operator handbook for publishing, compliance, and day-to-day usage of the ACGME Case Submitter Chrome extension.

## Single Purpose (Policy Statement)

This extension has one narrow purpose: **help authorized ADS users import a standardized case-log spreadsheet and fill the ACGME ADS Case Entry form for user-directed submission**.

It is not a general web automation tool, scraper, crawler, or account-access utility.

## Audience

This extension is intended **only** for anesthesia residents at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) with authorized ACGME ADS credentials. First-run requires explicit confirmation of this before the extension can be used.

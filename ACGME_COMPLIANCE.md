# ACGME Compliance and Disclaimer

Last reviewed: `2026-02-20`

## Non-affiliation statement

This project is an independent tool and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by,
or sponsored by ACGME**.

## Purpose and scope

This extension is intended to help authorized users transfer already-approved
case data into the ACGME ADS Case Entry workflow. It does not create, grant, or
expand access rights to ADS.

## Policy-aware usage expectations

Use this extension only when all of the following are true:

1. You have authorized ADS access credentials.
2. Your institution/program permits this workflow.
3. Your usage complies with ACGME Terms of Use and ADS-specific terms.
4. You are not using the tool for scraping, copying, mirroring, bypassing
   security controls, or unauthorized account access.

## Important automation caveat

ACGME Terms of Use include restrictions on use of robots/spiders/automated
means to monitor or copy site content, and on unauthorized access.

Because this extension automates form interaction, you should obtain explicit
approval from your institution/program (and, where needed, ACGME) before using
bulk automation features such as BEAST mode.

If approval is unclear, do not use automation features.

## What this disclaimer does not do

- It does not provide legal advice.
- It does not guarantee compliance in all environments.
- It does not waive, supersede, or modify ACGME or ADS terms.

Compliance responsibility remains with the user and their institution.

## Public-facing statement template

Use this wording in docs/listings:

`This tool is intended only for authorized ADS users and policy-compliant, user-directed case-entry workflows. It does not bypass access controls, is not a scraping/mirroring tool, and is not affiliated with ACGME.`
